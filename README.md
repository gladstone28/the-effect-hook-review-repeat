The Effect Hook
Review
1 min
In this lesson, we learned how to write effects that manage timers, manipulate the DOM, and fetch data from a server. With the Effect Hook, we can perform these types of actions in function components with ease!

Let’s review the main concepts from this lesson:

We can import the useEffect() function from the 'react' library and call it in our function components.
Effect refers to a function that we pass as the first argument of the useEffect() function. By default, the Effect Hook calls this effect after each render.
The cleanup function is optionally returned by the effect. If the effect does anything that needs to be cleaned up to prevent memory leaks, then the effect returns a cleanup function, then the Effect Hook will call this cleanup function before calling the effect again as well as when the component is being unmounted.
The dependency array is the optional second argument that the useEffect() function can be called with in order to prevent repeatedly calling the effect when this is not needed. This array should consist of all variables that the effect depends on.
The Effect Hook is all about scheduling when our effect’s code gets executed. We can use the dependency array to configure when our effect is called in the following ways:

Dependency Array	Effect called after first render & …
undefined	every re-render
Empty array	no re-renders
Non-empty array	when any value in the dependency array changes
Hooks give us the flexibility to organize our code in different ways, grouping related data as well as separating concerns to keep code simple, error-free, reusable, and testable!
